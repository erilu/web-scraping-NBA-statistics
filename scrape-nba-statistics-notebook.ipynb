    "In this project, I use Python to “scrape” ESPN for stats on all the players in the NBA, clean and organize the data into a data science-friendly format, and calculate some interesting statistics. Web scraping is a useful technique for extracting data from websites that don’t offer formatted, raw data for download.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, I will be scraping data from the rosters of each team in the NBA for information such as player age, height, weight, and salary. I will also loop through each individual player's stats page and extract career averages such as points per game, free throw percentages, and more (as of currently, March 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this data to answer questions such as:\n",
    "* Do factors such as age, height, weight, etc. correlate with player performance? (i.e. does height matter?)\n",
    "* What is the average salary paid by each team in the NBA, and which player earns the most on each team?\n",
    "* How much more do better players cost? Can we model the average price of hiring a player given his performance? If so, what is the cost per increase in points per game?\n",
    "\n",
    "I've exported the data to a nicely organized csv file, accessible in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/erilu/web-scraping-NBA-statistics) for this project, in case you would like to analyze it yourself. You can also run the python script `scrape_nba_statistics.py` to re-scrape ESPN for up-to-date data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, I will describe how to loop through ESPN page sources using `urllib`, extract information using `re` (regular expressions), organize player statistics in `pandas` DataFrames, and perform some simple modeling using `scikit-learn`."

    "This was only meant to be a demonstration of what could be done with the data that we scraped. Better models can definitely be generated, especially given the nature of the data. Just by looking at the fit above, we can see that the residuals will be heteroskedastic. There are also a small number of players with high career points per game but low salaries in the bottom right corner of the plot which are skewing the regression line.\n",

    "Taking into account these caveats, the value of the slope is ~947619.16. This suggests that for every unit increase in points per game, the predicted salary paid to a player increases by $947,619.16! Looks like making that free throw really does count."

    "I hope what you've learned from this project will help you out on your own web scraping quests. The techniques that I've outlined here should be broadly applicable for other websites. In general, webpages that link to subpages within the same site will construct their links in some sort of standardized pattern. If so, you can construct URLs for the subpages and loop through them as we have done here. Next time you find yourself flipping through a website and copy-pasting, consider trying to automate the process using Python!"
